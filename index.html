        <p class="lead mb-4"> Hi, my name is Jaselle Davalos. I've been pursuing higher education for two years now!This journey has been stressful, fun but enlightening all at the same time. The struggle of college has definitely impacted my life in unimaginable ways. For the last two years I have been working towards getting my bachelors degree in education.The classes that I have been taking have been geared towards just that. I love learning everyday about not only the history of education but all the way it has evolved over the years. All the ways how it has been beneficial to students and all the ways it has failed us. The question of how we can make it better is something that everyone should be working towards. Especially those who plan to work in that field that is why over the years I have been taking the time to work in the field as much as I can. I want to see how and why it can be fixed from the inside and experience it all first hand. 
<br><br>

       Some of the jobs that I have been involved with over the years have definitely given me insight on how the education system is flawed and how it can be better. Some of the jobs I have had have been being a teacher, being a tutor and even being an after school program worker. Being able to interact with the students has allowed me to become better at recognizing what it is that they need to succeed. One major flaw is that students need teachers who are passionate about what they are doing. They need role models who understand their position in their life and wont take that lightly. They need to understand that education is not a given but a luxury. And they need to be taught about more real life applicable things. Many students don't even understand how important the education they are receiving is. Many students don't feel supported and that is not okay. Other students have more resources and that makes it harder for those who donâ€™t have those resources to have as many immediate opportunities. The system is flawed.
<br><br>

        I can bring so much to the table. Not only do I have the motivation and passion to make the education system better. I am a go getter and believe nothing is impossible. All students should be supported, loved, and given the proper resources. I have worked in the education field long enough to resonate with all the personal struggles of the students and to understand that the system we currently have set in place is designed for minorities and the lower class to fail. I have strong interpersonal skills and I am very open minded. The amount of experience I have in this field makes me an excellent candidate for any business administration position. I am ready to help make a difference in this system and apply my counseling skills to understanding the needs of the students in today's progressive world.
